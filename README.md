## Introduction

As a podcast enthusiast, you may often find it challenging to discover the most interesting episodes from your subscriptions. The Podcast Discovery Newsletter Generator aims to solve this problem by creating personalized newsletters that summarize each week's podcast releases. These newsletters provide key details about each episode, making it easier for you to decide which episodes to prioritize.

## Approach

The project is divided into three main parts to ensure a comprehensive and seamless experience:

### Part 1: Information Extraction

We employ a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) from OpenAI to extract essential information from podcast episodes. This includes details about the guest, main topics discussed, and highlights. Additionally, a Speech to Text model is used to transcribe the podcast content, aiding in accurate information extraction.

### Part 2: Backend Deployment

The information extraction functionality is deployed on a cloud server to ensure on-demand processing. This backend server handles the processing of the latest episodes and generates the content for the personalized newsletters.

### Part 3: Frontend User Interface

The ChatGPT from OpenAI serves as your coding assistant for creating and deploying a user-friendly frontend. This frontend provides an intuitive interface for users to input their podcast subscriptions, customize preferences, and receive the weekly newsletters.
